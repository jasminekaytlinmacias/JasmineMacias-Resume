        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Management</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current first-year at the University of California, RIverside. My passion and major is Business with the concentration of Business Administration. Although I am wary of what I would want to do in the near future, I am certain that regardless of what I choose to do, I will excel. This is due to my “give it my 100%” attitude and professional experiences that help guide me to success. Presently, I am open to any job opportunity that I feel is best suited for me and the skills I possess. I am currently intrigued about going into Human Resources, with hopes of becoming a Human Resource Director with time. This is due to my ability of being able to work closely with a staff yet being able to assert what is best for the workspace. My leadership capabilities allow me to lay ground rules and assess that the staff be following them as expected. 
<br><br>

        In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books that help me expand my knowledge on both an academic level and emotional. Books help me keep grounded, both relieving me from the stresses of day-to-day work while only helping me grasp more insightful information. I always tend to be reading two types of books; a fun book and a book related to my work. For example, my fun book as of right now is Stephen King’s suspenseful thriller “Nightmares & Dreamscapes”. For a book that is more in line with my academics would be something like “Good to Great” by Jim Collins. Both of these books I have had a hard time trying to put down, both serving their purpose in enlightening me in multiple, beneficial ways. Having a hobby like this builds my personal perspective on situations and reflects on my experiences. This is what helps me stay well-rounded and sincere when working in business.<br><br>

        Lastly, my greatest accomplishments will always have to do with family. I hold my parents and other family members very dear to me. Coming from a family of low-income workers, I have been humble of my opportunities. My successes have always been parted onto them. After all, what is success without people to share it with? That is why I find myself to be considerate of families and workers when studying business and in any line of work I do. I do what is best not only for the company, but for the customers as well. I find that being a trusted, reliable company, success will almost always closely follow. If we were to step on workers and exploit families, then we are anything but an ethical company. To get ahead and succeed is to make sure that our customers are satisfied and treated morally right. Responsibility, integrity, sincerity-- all traits that are important for not only companies to embody, but also us as workers. We are a team and we are no better than our weakest teammate. That is why I hold it as my own civil duty to never abandon those who have helped me get this far, and to always support families/workers.
